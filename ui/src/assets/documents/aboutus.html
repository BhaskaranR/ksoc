            their products and services within their network eliminating the need for external marketing channels to acquire customers. Local deals are shown on a map to cater the needs of users seeking savings.

        </h3>
        <p class="docs-markdown-p">
            Target market includes the saturated yet evolving US social media segment where 68% of total population is registered. The market also includes all small businesses that want to promote deals locally and represent their brand as community supporters.
            We also cover aspiring entrepreneurs who want to start an online business and offer products and services. We aim niche demographics ages 13-34 (96 million), housewives, and all those who want to reap benefits for their time spent on social
            networks. This demographic has the highest chances of converting as people can use the money earned to purchase games or other necessary products. We also target those who do not want rewards but can donate to charities of their liking making
            a positive social impact.</p>

        <p class="docs-markdown-p">
            Our sources of revenue are multi pronged. User’s active social involvement generates advertisement income. Users can open ecommerce shops and pay commissions on sales and pay for promoting their brands. Businesses register and pay consistent membership
            fees to promote their deals locally. KarmaSoc will reach the targeted market through comprehensive marketing strategies, including advertisements, digital marketing, blogs, word of mouth referrals, and innovative techniques such as appointing
            representatives in each educational institute and volunteers in each region. Users will act sales agents to register local businesses. </p>

            Competition
        </h3>
        <p class="docs-markdown-p">
            Among competitors are traditional social platforms such as Facebook, Google+, YouTube, Groupon, Yext, Nextdoor, FourSquare, among others, which do not incentivize users and allow only active and professional users to benefit monetarily. We also compete
            with evolving blockchain technology firms including, Steemit, Synereo, Nexus, and Yours, which incentivize users for their content. KarmaSoc is distinct from any of these firms as we do not fully rely on an incentivizing business model but
            are developing a sustainable growth model offering innovative ways for users to be actively involved, thereby mutually benefiting each other.

            KarmaSoc will be a global app and will penetrate each market strategically. We will be one-stop shop for all types of incentives. Funding will help achieve these goals and also help with hiring, creating a native app, enhancing the current version of
            PWA, getting direct access to deals from companies, and offering cash back programs. Lastly, we are working on a Proof of Concept to use blockchain technology to implement micropayments. We intend to issue an ICO (Initial Coin Offering) to
            raise capital and be in the forefront of blockchain technology.
